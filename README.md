git clone https://github.com/mloolm/django_cms.git
cd django_cms
```

### Install Docker if itâ€™s not already installed:

Refer to the official Docker installation guide: [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
Refer to the official Docker Compose installation guide: [Docker Compose Docs](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install docker.io docker-compose
```

### Set up (or install) Nginx
Use the provided Nginx configuration template located at `nginx/dj_site.conf`. Reload Nginx after setup:

```sh
sudo nginx -s reload
```

### Create a `.env` file from the template and fill in the required values:

```sh
cp .env_template .env
```

### Build and start the Docker containers:

```sh
sudo docker-compose up --build -d
```

### Apply database migrations:

```sh
sudo make migrate
```

### Create a superuser account for admin access:

```sh
sudo make superuser
```

Your site is now ready! When deploying to production, remember to set `DJANGO_ENV` to `'production'` in the `.env` file.

## Usage

After installation, you can access the admin panel to manage your site's content, including blog posts, donation settings, and more. Customize the templates and styles in the Website module to match your branding.

For development purposes, keep `DJANGO_ENV` set to `'development'`. For production, switch it to `'production'` to enable optimized settings.

## Developing

### Frontend

To work with Webpack during development, you need to install `npm`:

```sh
sudo apt-get install npm
```

To start Webpack in watch mode, run the following command in the project directory:

```sh
npm run watch
```

For other available modes, check the `package.json` file.

### Backend

The dependency list is located in the `requirements.txt` file at the root of the project.

During development on a local machine, set `DJANGO_ENV` in the `.env` file to `'dev'`.

The website will be available on port `8000`. Example:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

For manual database management, access it on port `8080`. Example:

```
http://localhost:8080
```
